            <span>Please don’t feel limited by these options—there are lots of other great places to stay in the area! Downtown Bloomington has several Inns/Bed & Bed Breakfasts (I highly recommend the Grant Street Inn), there are more hotel options slightly further from the venue and there are some nice Airbnb’s in the area too!</span>
