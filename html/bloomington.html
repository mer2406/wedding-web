            <place href="http://runciblespoonrestaurant.com/" name="Runcible Spoon" address="412 E. 6th Street" zip="47408">Serves breakfast, lunch, and dinner. Would recommend this spot for any of their breakfast options and go ahead and treat yo’ self to that pitcher of mimosas you can order. If you go here be sure to check out their bathroom--just trust me.</place>
            <place href="http://www.villagedeli.biz/" name="Village Deli" address="409 E. Kirkwood Avenue" zip="47408">Serves breakfast, lunch, and dinner but this is another good breakfast option. Get one of their giant (but thin) pancakes or Paxton’s Potatoes (both Paxton’s Part I and II are tasty but I’ve always been partial to Part I).</place>
            <place href="http://the-uptown.com/" name="Uptown Cafe" address="102 E. Kirkwood Avenue" zip="47408">Serves breakfast, lunch, and dinner and I would recommend this for any of those options! It’s a bit of Bloomington institution and is considered by many to be the best restaurant in Bloomington.</place>
            <place href="http://www.irishlion.com/" name="Irish Lion" address="212 W. Kirkwood Avenue" zip="47404">Open for lunch and dinner serving traditional irish fare along with americanized versions of the cuisine. Highly recommend the blarney puff balls as your appetizers! Also has (probably) the most extensive whiskey and scotch selection in Bloomington.</place>
            <place href="http://www.tasteofindiabtown.com/" name="Taste of India" address="316 E. 4th Street" zip="47408">Honestly this is my favorite Indian restaurant of all time. Serves lunch and dinner but the best deal is definitely their lunch buffet (11-2:30 everyday). Not feeling like Indian food? Fourth Street has many other ethnic cuisine options like Thai (Little Tibet or Siam House), Chinese (Best Taste), Burmese (Mandalay), and Turkish/Mediterranean (Anatolia).</place>
            <place href="http://www.motherbearspizza.com/" name="Mother Bears" address="1428 E. 3rd Street" zip="47401">Open for lunch and dinner. This is hands-down the best pizza in Bloomington. Their traditional crust is a deep dish and has bit of Pequods vibe for you Chicago folks. I recommend The Deluxe and the Cheesy garlic bread.</place>

        <div class="panel-body">
            You can definitely spend the whole time you’re not partying at the wedding eating (and we wouldn’t blame you—there are so many awesome food options and eating is excellent) but if you don’t want to do that (because that would actually be really hard probably) here are some fun things you can do:\
            <ul>
                <li>Check out the Lily Library. This is a rare book and manuscript library.</li>
                <li>Visit the IU Art Museum (located across the street from the Lily Library).</li>
                <li>For the young (or just young at heart) visit The Wonderlab.</li>
                <li>Walk the B-Line Trail for some scenic exercise.</li>
                <li>Go on a Brewery Tour at Upland Brewing.</li>
                <li>Get some of that famous Indiana corn: the Bloomington Farmer's Market is on Saturday from 8am to 1pm and definitely worth a visit.</li>
            </ul>
